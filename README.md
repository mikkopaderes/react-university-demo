# React University Demo

This is a repo for me to practice in React. I'm more of an [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) guy but I get that I need to learn the other popular frameworks to be competitive.

This is a simple app that's able to display all the Universities in the world by using [Hipo/university-domains-list](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list). In addition, you can subscribe to a University to get updates from them (in theory).

The subscription is powered by Firebase using its local emulator.

**TODO**:

- Debounced searching
- Stylelint
- Sorting by University name and Country
- Register, Login, be able to favorite a University
- Reusable UI for common components such as buttons, inputs, etc.
